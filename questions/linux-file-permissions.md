## Answer

File permissions in Linux control who can read, write, or execute files and directories. They're a fundamental security feature that determines access rights for different users.

## Background information

### Permission types

There are three basic permission types:
- Read (r): View file contents or list directory contents
- Write (w): Modify file contents or create/delete files in a directory
- Execute (x): Run a file as a program or enter a directory

### User categories

Permissions are set for three categories of users:
- Owner: The user who owns the file
- Group: Users who belong to the file's group
- Other: All other users on the system
