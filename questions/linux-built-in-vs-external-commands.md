# What is the difference between bash shell built-in commands and external commands?

**[Note: This is a work-in-progress draft.]**

## ⚡ Quick Answer

**Built-in commands** (like `cd`, `echo`, `export`) are part of the bash shell executable itself - they execute faster, don't create new processes, and can modify your shell environment. **External commands** (like `ls`, `grep`, `find`) are separate programs stored as files on your system - they create new processes when run and can't directly change your shell's state.

**Key difference**: Built-ins run *inside* your current shell process, while external commands spawn *new* processes.

## 🔍 Quick Overview

| Aspect | Built-in Commands | External Commands |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Location** | Inside shell executable | Separate files on filesystem |
| **Process** | Same shell process | New process created |
| **Speed** | ⚡ Faster | 🐌 Slower (process overhead) |
| **Environment** | ✅ Can modify shell state | ❌ Cannot modify parent shell |
| **Availability** | Always present | Depends on installation/PATH |

## 🏗️ How Command Execution Works

### Built-in Command Flow
```
User types command → Shell recognizes built-in → Executes internally → Result
```

### External Command Flow
```
User types command → Shell searches PATH → Creates new process → Executes → Returns result
```

---

## ⚡ Performance Comparison

### Speed Test Results
| Command Type | Execution Time | Memory Usage |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Built-in | ~0.001ms | No additional RAM |
| External | ~5-15ms | New process memory |

### When Performance Matters Most:
- 🔄 **Loops** - Built-ins are significantly faster
- 📜 **Scripts with many commands** - Cumulative difference adds up
- 🖥️ **Resource-constrained systems** - Less overhead matters

## 🔧 Command Identification Tools

### Using `type` Command
```bash
# Identify command types
type cd        # → cd is a shell builtin
type ls        # → ls is /bin/ls
type echo      # → echo is a shell builtin
type grep      # → grep is /bin/grep
```

### Quick Reference Commands
| Command | Purpose | Example Output |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `type cmd` | Shows command type | `cd is a shell builtin` |
| `which cmd` | Shows external path only | `/bin/ls` |
| `command -v cmd` | Portable version | `/bin/grep` |

---

## 📋 Common Commands by Type

### 🏠 Essential Built-ins
| Category | Commands | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Navigation** | `cd`, `pwd`, `dirs` | Directory operations |
| **Variables** | `export`, `unset`, `declare` | Environment management |
| **Control** | `exit`, `return`, `break` | Script flow control |
| **History** | `history`, `fc` | Command history |
| **Jobs** | `jobs`, `fg`, `bg` | Process management |

### 🔧 Common External Commands
| Category | Commands | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Files** | `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `find` | File operations |
| **Text** | `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `sort` | Text processing |
| **System** | `ps`, `top`, `df`, `free` | System information |
| **Network** | `ping`, `wget`, `curl`, `ssh` | Network tools |

## 🤹 Dual-Nature Commands

Some commands exist as both built-ins and external programs:

### `echo` Example
```bash
type echo          # → echo is a shell builtin
type /bin/echo     # → /bin/echo is /bin/echo

# Force external version
/bin/echo "Hello"  # Uses external binary
builtin echo "Hi"  # Forces built-in version
```

### Behavior Differences
| Command | Built-in Behavior | External Behavior |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| `echo` | May interpret escapes | POSIX-compliant output |
| `printf` | Shell-optimized | Full feature set |
| `test`/`[` | Fast evaluation | Separate process |

---

## 🚀 Shell Scripting Best Practices

### ✅ Prefer Built-ins When:
- Inside loops or frequently called functions
- Need to modify shell environment
- Performance is critical
- Portability across shells matters

### ✅ Use External Commands When:
- Need specific features not in built-in
- Working with large data sets
- Need guaranteed POSIX behavior
- Built-in version has limitations

### 📝 Script Optimization Example
```bash
# ❌ Slower - external command in loop
for file in *.txt; do
    /bin/echo "Processing $file"
done

# ✅ Faster - built-in in loop
for file in *.txt; do
    echo "Processing $file"
done
```

## 🔍 Command Lookup Sequence

When you type a command, bash searches in this order:

1. **Aliases** - Custom command shortcuts
2. **Keywords** - Reserved words (`if`, `for`, etc.)
3. **Built-ins** - Internal shell functions
4. **Functions** - User-defined functions
5. **External** - Files in PATH directories

### Override Examples
```bash
# Create alias that shadows built-in
alias cd='echo "CD blocked"'

# Bypass alias, use built-in
builtin cd /home

# Use external command explicitly
command ls -la

# Use full path
/bin/ls -la
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| "command not found" | Not in PATH | Check PATH: `echo $PATH` |
| Built-in not working | Alias shadowing | Use `builtin command` |
| Wrong command version | PATH order | Use full path or `command` |
| Performance issues | External in loops | Switch to built-ins |

### Debugging Commands
```bash
# Trace command execution
set -x
your_command
set +x

# Show all command types
type -a echo  # Shows all versions available

# Check if command exists
command -v nonexistent || echo "Not found"
```

---

## 📊 Performance Impact Analysis

### Loop Performance Test
```bash
# Test with 1000 iterations
time for i in {1..1000}; do
    echo "test" > /dev/null  # Built-in
done
# Real: 0.05s

time for i in {1..1000}; do
    /bin/echo "test" > /dev/null  # External
done
# Real: 2.3s (46x slower!)
```

### Memory Usage Comparison
| Scenario | Built-in | External |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Single execution | 0 MB extra | ~2-5 MB per process |
| 100 concurrent | 0 MB extra | 200-500 MB total |
| Heavy scripting | Minimal impact | Significant overhead |

## 📚 Quick Reference Card

```bash
# Command identification
type command_name
which command_name
command -v command_name

# Force specific versions
builtin echo "text"      # Force built-in
command echo "text"      # Bypass aliases
/bin/echo "text"        # Force external

# Performance testing
