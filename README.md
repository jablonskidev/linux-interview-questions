# Linux interview questions

## Who this is for

This is for Linux users who want an efficient way to prepare for interviews.

This is not for learners who are new to Linux. To keep the articles short and skimmable, I did not break down terms and concepts enough for true beginners.

## What you will get

In each article, you will get:
- An interview question
- A short version of the answer
- A deeper explanation of the answer
- A quiz

## Questions
